**Chapter 02 [How to Use Emacs, an Excellent Clojure Editor](https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)**

I highly recommend working with Emacs, but you can, of course, use any editor you want. Two alternatives that I recommend and that are well regarded in the community are [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) and [Nightcode](https://sekao.net/nightcode/).

By the end of this chapter, your Emacs setup will look something like this:

# Installation
**OS X:**

http://emacsformacosx.com

**Archlinux:**

```
yay emacs
```
# Configuration

The author's Configuration:
- https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure

My Emacs's Configuration:
- https://github.com/keer2345/keer-emacs/blob/master/lisp/lang-clojure.el

When you open Emacs, you may see a lot of activity as Emacs downloads a bunch of useful packages. Once the activity stops, go ahead and just quit Emacs, and then open it again. After you do so, you should see a window like this:


<div align="center">

# Use Emacs with Clojure
## Fire Up Your REPL!
In [Chapter 1](https://github.com/keer2345/clojure-learning/blob/master/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/ch01.md), you started the REPL in a terminal window with `lein repl`.

In Emacs, to connect Emacs to a REPL, you’ll use the Emacs package [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/). CIDER allows you to start a REPL within Emacs and provides you with key bindings that allow you to interact with the REPL more efficiently. Go ahead and start a REPL session now. Using Emacs, open the file `clojure-noob/src/clojure_noob/core.clj`. Next, use **M-x** `cider-jack-in`. This starts the REPL and creates a new buffer where you can interact with it. You should see something
like:


<div align="center">
    <img src="https://www.braveclojure.com/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/cider-jack-in.png">
</div>

Type in the following bolded lines. The result that you should see printed in the REPL when you press enter is shown after each line of code:

```clojure
clojure-noob.core> (+ 1 2 3 4)
10
clojure-noob.core> (map inc [1 2 3 4])
(2 3 4 5)
clojure-noob.core> (reduce + [5 6 2])
13
```

## Interlude: Emacs Windows and Frames

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://www.braveclojure.com/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/emacs-windows.png">
</div>

Emacs Window Key Bindings

Keys |Description
----|----:
*C-x o* |Switch cursor to another window. Try this now to switch between your Clojure file and the REPL.
*C-x 1* |Delete all other windows, leaving only the current window in the frame. This doesn’t close your buffers, and it won’t cause you to lose any work.
*C-x 2* |Split frame above and below.
*C-x 3* |Split frame side by side.
*C-x 0* |Delete current window. 

## A Cornucopia of Useful Key Bindings

At the bottom of core.clj, add the following:
```clojure
(println "Cleanliness is next to godliness")
```
Now use **C-e** to navigate to the end of the line, and then use **C-x C-e**. `The text Cleanliness` is next to godliness should appear in the CIDER buffer, as shown in Figure:


<div align="center">
    <img src="https://www.braveclojure.com/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/cider-eval-last-expression.png">
</div>

Now let’s try to run the `-main` function we wrote in Chapter 1 so we can let the world know that we’re little teapots.

In the *core.clj* buffer, use **C-c M-n M-n** (`cider-repl-set-ns`). This key binding sets the namespace to the namespace listed at the top of your current file, so the prompt in the right window should now read `clojure-noob.core>`. Next, enter `(-main)` at the prompt. The REPL should print `I'm a little teapot!`:

```clojure
clojure-noob.core> (-main)
I'm a little teapot!
nil
```

Now let’s create a new function and run it. At the bottom of *core.clj*, add the following:
```clojure
(defn train
  []
  (println "Choo choo!"))
```

Save your file and use **C-c C-k** `cider-load-buffer` , run `(train)` in the REPL buffer, it will  echo back `Choo choo!`.
```clojure
clojure-noob.core> (train)
Choo choo!
nil
```

Clojure Buffer Key Bindings:

Keys |Description
----|----:
C-c M-n M-n |Switch to namespace of current buffer.
C-x C-e |Evaluate expression immediately preceding point.
C-c C-k |Compile current buffer.
C-c C-d C-d |Display documentation for symbol under point.
M-. and M-, |Navigate to source code for symbol under point and return to your original buffer.
C-c C-d C-a |Apropros search; find arbitrary text across function names and documentation.

CIDER Buffer Key Bindings:


Keys |Description
----|----:
C-↑, C-↓ |Cycle through REPL history.
C-enter |Close parentheses and evaluate. 


## How to Handle Errors
Type `(take)` and press enter. You should see something like:

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://www.braveclojure.com/assets/images/cftbat/basic-emacs/cider-error.png">
</div>

It shows an `ArityException` error message in your REPL buffer and fills your left window with text that looks like the ravings of a madman. These ravings are the *stack trace*, which shows the function that actually threw the exception, along with which function called that function, down the stack of function calls.

Press **q** to close the stack trace and go back to CIDER.

If you want to view the error again, you can switch to the `*cider-error*` buffer. You can also get error messages when trying to compile files. To see this, go to the core.clj buffer, write some buggy code, and compile:

1. Add `(take)` to the end.
1. Use **C-c C-k** to compile.

## Paredit
Keys |Description
----|----:
M-x paredit-mode |Toggle paredit mode.
M-( |Surround expression after point in parentheses (paredit-wrap-round).
C-→ |Slurp; move closing parenthesis to the right to include next expression.
C-← |Barf; move closing parenthesis to the left to exclude last expression.
C-M-f, C-M-b |Move to the opening/closing parenthesis.
