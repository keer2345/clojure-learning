**Chapter 05 [Functional Programming](https://www.braveclojure.com/functional-programming/)**

The core concepts you’ll learn include:
- what pure functions are and why they’re useful
- how to work with immutable data structures and why they’re superior to their mutable cousins
- how disentangling data and functions gives you more power and flexibility
- why it’s powerful to program to a small set of data abstractions 

Once you shove all this knowledge into your brain matter, you’ll have an entirely new approach to problem solving!

# Pure Functions: What and Why
A function is pure if it meets two qualifications:

- It always returns the same result if given the same arguments. This is called *referential transparency*
- It can’t cause any side effects. That is, the function can’t make any changes that are observable outside the function itself 

## Pure Functions Are Referentially Transparent
To return the same result when called with the same argument, pure functions
rely only on:
- their own arguments
- immutable values to determine their return value

``` clojure
(+ 1 2)
; => 3
```
## Pure Functions Have No Side Effects
# Living with Immutable Data Structures
## Recursion Instead of for/while
## Function Composition Instead of Attribute Mutation
``` clojure
(require '[clojure.string :as s])
(defn clean
  [text]
  (s/replace (s/trim text) #"lol" "LOL"))

(clean "My boa constrictor is so sassy lol!  ")
; => "My boa constrictor is so sassy LOL!"
```
