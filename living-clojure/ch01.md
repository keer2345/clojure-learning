# Baby Steps with Simple Value
# Put Your Clojure Data in Collections
## Using a List Collection
To create a list in Clojure, simply put a quote in front of the parens, and put
your data inside of theme:

``` clojure
'(1 2 "jam" :marmalade-jar)
;; -> (1 2 "jam" :marmalade-jar)

'(1, 2, "jam", :bee)
;; -> (1 2 "jam" :bee)
```
## What Can We Do with Lists?

``` clojure
(first '(:rabbit :pocket-watch :marmalade :door))
;; -> :rabbit
(rest '(:rabbit :pocket-watch :marmalade :door))
;; -> (:pocket-watch :marmalade :door)
(first (rest (rest (rest (rest '(:rabbit :pocket-watch :marmalade :door))))))
;; -> nil
```
```clojure
(cons 5 '())
;; -> (5)

;; building the list with a nil
(cons 5 nil)
;; -> (5)

(cons 4 (cons 5 nil))
;; -> (4 5)

(cons 3 (cons 4 (cons 5 nil)))
;; -> (3 4 5)

(cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 (cons 5 nil))))
;; -> (2 3 4 5)
```
```clojure
'(1 2 3 4 5)
;; -> (1 2 3 4 5)
(list 1 2 3 4 5)
;; -> (1 2 3 4 5)
```

## Using Vectors for Collecting Data by Index
Vectors are very handy and quite common in Clojure. You can spot them by their square
brackets:
```clojure
[:jar1 1 2 3 :jar2]
;; -> [:jar1 1 2 3 :jar2]

(first [:jar1 1 2 3 :jar2])
;; -> :jar1

(rest [:jar1 1 2 3 :jar2])
;; -> (1 2 3 :jar2)
```

Unlike lists, in vectors, you have fast index access to the elements.
```clojure
(nth [:jar1 1 2 3 :jar2] 0)
;; -> :jar1
(nth [:jar1 1 2 3 :jar2] 2)
;; -> 2
```
```clojure
;; last with a vector
(last [:rabbit :pocket-watch :marmalade])
;; -> :marmalade
;; last with a list
(last '(:rabbit :pocket-watch :marmalade))
;; -> :marmalade
```
## What Collections Have in Common
```clojure
(count [1 2 3 4])
;; -> 4
```

``` clojure
;; conj adds to the end of vectors
(conj [:toast :butter] :jam)
;; -> [:toast :butter :jam]

;; multiple elements added on end of vectors
(conj [:toast :butter] :jam :honey)
;; -> [:toast :butter :jam :honey]
```
For lists, it will add them on to the beginning:

``` clojure
;; conj adds to the front of lists
(conj '(:toast :butter) :jam)
;; -> (:jam :toast :butter)

;; multiple elements added to the front of lists
(conj '( :toast :butter) :jam :honey)
;; -> (:honey :jam :toast :butter)
```

## Maps for Storing Key-Value Pairs of Data

``` clojure
{:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry"}
;; -> {:jam2 "blackberry", :jam1 "strawberry"}
```
Commas, again, are considered whitespace in Clojure. Maps are the one place that it can
be idiomatic to leave the commas in for readability. Leave them in if it helps you:

``` clojure
{:jam1 "strawberry", :jam2 "blackberry"}
;; -> {:jam2 "blackberry", :jam1 "strawberry"}

{:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry"}
;; -> {:jam2 "blackberry", :jam1 "strawberry"}
```
You can get values out of maps using the get function:

``` clojure
;; explicit get
(get {:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry"} :jam2)
;; -> "blackberry"

(get {:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry"} :jam3 "not found")
;; -> "not found"

;; getting using the key as the function
(:jam2 {:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry" :jam3 "marmalade"})
;; -> "blackberry"
```

The `keys` and `vals` functions return just the keys or values of the map:

``` clojure
;; the keys function
(keys {:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry" :jam3 "marmalade"})
;; -> (:jam3 :jam2 :jam1)

;;the vals function
(vals {:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry" :jam3 "marmalade"})
;; -> ("marmalade" "blackberry" "strawberry")
```

> Remember, collections are immutable. A function to change a collection gives
> you back a new version of the collection.


The `assoc` function associates the new key-value pairs to map:

``` clojure
(assoc {:jam1 "red" :jam2 "black"} :jam1 "orange")
;; -> {:jam2 "black", :jam1 "orange"}
```
The `dissoc` function returns a new map with the key-value pair removed:

``` clojure
(dissoc {:jam1 "strawberry" :jam2 "blackberry"} :jam1)
;; -> {:jam2 "blackberry"}
```

The `merge` function is also quite handy to merge the key-value pairs from one
map to the other:

``` clojure
(merge {:jam1 "red" :jam2 "black"}
{:jam1 "orange" :jam3 "red"}
{:jam4 "blue"})
;; -> {:jam4 "blue", :jam3 "red", :jam2 "black", :jam1 "orange"}
```

# Using Sets for Unique Collections of Data

``` clojure
#{:red :blue :white :pink}
;; -> #{:white :red :blue :pink}
;; No duplicates allowed in the set at creation

#{:red :blue :white :pink :pink}
;; -> IllegalArgumentException Duplicate key: :pink
```


``` clojure
(require '[clojure.set :as set])

(clojure.set/union #{:r :b :w} #{:w :p :y})
;; -> #{:y :r :w :b :p}

(clojure.set/difference #{:r :b :w} #{:w :p :y})
;; -> #{:r :b}

(clojure.set/intersection #{:r :b :w} #{:w :p :y})
;; -> #{:w}
```
You can convert another type of collection to a set using the set function. This
is useful for using set operations on things like vectors. Maps can be converted to sets as
well. The key-value pairs are turned into vectors:

``` clojure
(set [:rabbit :rabbit :watch :door])
;; -> #{:door :watch :rabbit}

(set {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
;; -> #{[:c 3] [:b 2] [:a 1]}
```
To get an element from a set, you can use the `get` function.

``` clojure
(get #{:rabbit :door :watch} :rabbit)
;; -> :rabbit

(get #{:rabbit :door :watch} :jar)
;; -> nil
```
We can also access it directly using the keyword:

``` clojure
(:rabbit #{:rabbit :door :watch})
;; -> :rabbit
```
The set itself can be used as a function to do the same thing:

``` clojure
(#{ :rabbit :door :watch} :rabbit)
;; -> :rabbit
```

``` clojure
(contains? #{:rabbit :door :watch} :rabbit)
;; -> true
(contains? #{:rabbit :door :watch} :jam)
;; -> false
```

``` clojure
(conj #{:rabbit :door} :jam)
;; -> #{:door :rabbit :jam}

(disj #{:rabbit :door} :door)
;; -> #{:rabbit}
```

# Lists Are the Heart of Clojure
This basic structure of Clojure comes from its LISP nature. The actual name LISP comes
from LISt Processing. Lists are a key data structure.

``` clojure
'("marmalade-jar" "empty-jar" "pickle-jam-jar")
```

``` clojure
(first '(+ 1 1))
;; -> +
```
# Symbols and the Art of Binding

``` clojure
(def developer "Alice")
;; -> #'user/developer

developer
;; -> "Alice"

user/developer
;; -> "Alice"
```

``` clojure
(def developer "Alice")
;; -> #'user/developer

(let [developer "Alice in Wonderland"]
developer)
;; -> "Alice in Wonderland"

developer
;; -> "Alice"
```

``` clojure
(let [developer "Alice in Wonderland"
rabbit "White Rabbit"]
[developer rabbit])
;; -> ["Alice in Wonderland" "White Rabbit"]

rabbit
;; -> CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException:
;; -> Unable to resolve symbol: rabbit in this context
```

# Creating Our Own Functions

``` clojure
(defn follow-the-rabbit [] "Off we go!")
;; -> #'user/follow-the-rabbit

(follow-the-rabbit)
;; -> "Off we go!"

(defn shop-for-jams [jam1 jam2]
{:name "jam-basket"
:jam1 jam1
:jam2 jam2})
;; -> #'user/shop-for-jams
(shop-for-jams "strawberry" "marmalade")
;; -> {:name "jam-basket", :jam1 "strawberry", :jam2 "marmalade"}
 ```
Sometimes you need to use a function briefly, but don’t want to name it. These
are `anonymous functions`. 

``` clojure
;;returns back a function
(fn [] (str "Off we go" "!"))
;; -> #<user$eval790$fn__791 user$eval790$fn__791@2ecd16a2>

;;invoke with parens
((fn [] (str "Off we go" "!")))
```

``` clojure
(def follow-again (fn [] (str "Off we go" "!")))
;; -> #'user/follow-again
(follow-again)
;; -> "Off we go!"
```
There is a shorthand form of an anonymous function, too. It uses a `#` in front of the parens:

``` clojure
(#(str "Off we go" "!"))
;; -> "Off we go!"
```
Or if there are multiple parameters, you can number the percent signs — for example, `%1`,
`%2`, and so on:

``` clojure
(#(str "Off we go" "!" " - " %1 %2) "again" "?")
;; -> "Off we go! - again?"
```


## Keep Your Symbols Organized in Namespaces

``` clojure
(ns alice.favfoods)
;; -> nil

(def fav-food "strawberry jam")
;; -> #'alice.favfoods/fav-food

alice.favfoods/fav-food
;; -> "strawberry jam"

(ns rabbit.favfoods)
;; -> nil
fav-food
;; -> CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException:
;; -> Unable to resolve symbol: fav-food in this context

(ns rabbit.favfoods)
(def fav-food "lettuce soup")
;; -> #'rabbit.favfoods/fav-food
fav-food
;; -> "lettuce soup"

alice.favfoods/fav-food
;; -> "strawberry jam"
```

``` clojure
(require 'clojure.set)

;; Union
(clojure.set/union #{:r :b :w} #{:w :p :y})
;; -> #{:y :r :w :b :p}
```

``` clojure
(ns wonderland)
;; -> nil
;; using an alias
(require '[alice.favfoods :as af])
;; -> nil
af/fav-food
;; -> "strawberry jam"
```

``` clojure
(ns wonderland
	(:require [alice.favfoods :as af]))
af/fav-food
;; -> "strawberry jam"
```

``` clojure
(ns wonderland
	(:require [alice.favfoods :refer :all]
	[rabbit.favfoods :refer :all]))
;; -> Exception:
;; fav-food already refers to: #'alice.favfoods/fav-food
;; in namespace: wonderland
```

``` clojure
(ns wonderland
	(:require [clojure.set :as s]))

(defn common-fav-foods [foods1 foods2]
	(let [food-set1 (set foods1)
		food-set2 (set foods2)
		common-foods (s/intersection food-set1 food-set2)]
	(str "Common Foods: " common-foods)))

(common-fav-foods [:jam :brownies :toast]
	[:lettuce :carrots :jam])
;; -> "Common Foods: #{:jam}"
```
